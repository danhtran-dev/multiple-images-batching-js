# multiple-images-batching-js

# How this script was invented
My friend asked me to code a tool that can generate all of styles of his cartoon character from several items like Background, HUD, Accessories ...

# Easy to use
Setup your photo into 3 folders Background, Main, HUD

Then `node images-batching.js`

GLHF!
